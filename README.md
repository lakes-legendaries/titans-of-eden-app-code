Welcome to the online demo for Titans of Eden, an upcoming tabletop card game that will launch on KickStarter in 2021. This demo is meant to teach players how to play, giving them insight into how the real game will look and feel when it launches. It can be played in a browser at http://www.TitansOfEden.com/online-demo  
  
Please pardon any bugs or errors that arise on this app: We are focusing our attention on developing the tabletop card game, and only created this online demo as a way to reach out to new players. (Personally, we are always nervous backing an unproven KickStarter game, so we're hoping to give potential backers an honest taste of what Titans Of Eden has to offer.) We actually learned JavaScript and Phaser from scratch just to code this app...
